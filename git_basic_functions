Git basic notes:

git converts info into a SHA1 hash.
the has will represent the information.

git can have commits, blobs and trees. 

blobs are the main data which the user has added, 
	this can include code, documentation, etc

tree are a middleground connecting data. 

	contain same information as commits,
 		commit hash,
		Author name, Author email (whoever created the commit)
		Date of the commit
		commit message
		
	work similar to directories/file folders
	have same info as a commit. 



commits are a hash which shows the info which is was active when it was made
	a subtype of tree. 
	commits can contain parents to previous commits.
	parent commits/hashes will contain:

If there are previous commits it will also contain a parent tree:

parent trees will indicate additional data which the next data contains. 
	parent directories work in a similar way and same principle 
	where the date is currently saved.

branches are commit with where the history/parent tree are different.
	branches can be merged to combine two different histories  

eg: main -> secondCommit -> extra commit -> preMerge \
	\					      >	Post Merge, contains two parent trees. 
	 >Branch -> some info->something->Postmerge  /
